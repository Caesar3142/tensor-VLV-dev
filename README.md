Tensor-CFD is a project developed by pttensor.com to help accelerate the deployment of OpenFOAM technology in real-world industrial applications. 
It consists of a collection of templates for specific applications. You simply copy and paste the template, then replace it with your own geometry or boundary conditions! 
Tensor VLV is a part of Tensor CFD project, designed for valve simulation and design for incompressible, steady, isothermal, with RAS turbulent model to simulate various valve model with single inlet and outlet. 
Please include credit to "tensor-VLV" in your work as acknowledgment if you use this template folder.
